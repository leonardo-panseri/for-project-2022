## Problem
### Miniproject
A company wants to plan the construction of mini-markets so that each house is at most r kilometers away (Euclidean distance) from a mini-market, and the total construction cost is minimized. The goal was to develop a MILP formulation of the problem and implement it in Python using the MIP module.
